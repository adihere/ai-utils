Production-Grade Implementation Requirements

Use Turborepo monorepo structure with separate apps (Next.js/NestJS) and shared packages (UI/utils)

Enforce Node.js LTS version with .nvmrc + engine-strict in .npmrc

Implement layered logging (debug/info/error) with correlation IDs and environment toggle

Write JSDoc comments for all complex functions including params, returns, and error cases

Achieve 80%+ test coverage with Jest/Testing Library, including edge cases

Validate all user inputs and API responses with Zod schemas

Use exact package versions (package-lock.json) and audit dependencies weekly

Add healthcheck endpoints (/_health) with DB connection tests

Document key architectural decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Configure CI/CD pipeline with lint-test-build-deploy stages

Implement proper error handling with contextual messages (no console.error raw)

Use environment variables for secrets with validation on app startup

Add performance metrics (response times, memory usage)

Follow RESTful practices for APIs: proper status codes, versioning, and pagination

Include // TODO-AI comments where human review is critical
